- Agressive: follows the player and attacks.
- Defensive: gets close to player but keeps a distance to perform attacks.

## TODO-FOR-FUTURE-ME
Since the limit of space was 13kbs I was out of space but in the future I may:
- Implement A* algorithm for the enemies to walk.
- Implement armor items so player/enemeis can have an aditional shield "life" bar wich takes damage before the player/enemies real life.
- Implemente general rougelike items to increase player life, atk base dmg, defence, etc.
- Implemente more environment traps and sprites, like trees, bear traps, wood walls, etc.
- Investigate a strange performance problem where the game slows down, can't figure out if it's due to the animation system used. It doesn't seem to be a memory leak, maybe garbage collector... But memory seems to be cleaned normally without causing issues... I have no idea. Maybe it's a problem with my machine since people don't seem to have the same issue.

### Setup
Run `npm install` on a terminal

### Development
Run `npm run start` to start the game in a development server on `localhost:8080`.

### Production
Use `npm run build` to create minified file and zip him with the `index.html`. The result will be available in the `build` directory.
